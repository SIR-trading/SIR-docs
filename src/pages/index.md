## What is SIR

Synthetics Implemented Right (SIR) is a new DeFi protocol producing two types of synthetic tokens. One the one hand it allows for the permissionless creation of
- leveraged ETFs for any pair of tokens that exist in Uniswap v3,

and on the other hand it provides
- synthetic tokens pegged 1-to-1 to other tokens and backed by any collateral of choice.

In order to be maximally trustless:
1. SIR's smart contracts are immutable (i.e., they cannot be modified by anone)
2. counterparty risk is minimized by only interacting with the Uniswap v3 protocol.

SIR is built as a layer on top of Uniswap v3 that unlocks the possibility of tokenized leveraged trading and the permissionless creation of all types of stable tokens.


## Why SIR?

We are aming to trustable stable tokens together with leverage trading to offer the best of both worlds; decentralized stable tokens with low risk, that will grow with fees, and leverage trading for maximum capital eficiency for a different kind of investment.
SIRâ€™s stable tokens share the symbol `TEA` and the leveraged ETFs share the symbol `APE`.

## Leveraged ETFs on the rise

**[There has been a lot of demand for leverage trading lately](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-based-leverage-trading-protocol-162512422.html?guccounter=1)**, but the amount of decentralized products is still very limited.
We believe rebalancing leverage, lowering the risk of liquidation, is the future of leverage trading
