# What is SIR

Synthetics Implemented Right (SIR) is a new protocol in the block offering two types of synthetic tokens.


## Why SIR?

We are aming to trustable stable tokens together with leverage trading to offer the best of both worlds; decentralized stable tokens with low risk, that will grow with fees, and leverage trading for maximum capital eficiency for a different kind of investment.
SIRâ€™s stable tokens share the symbol `TEA` and the leveraged ETFs share the symbol `APE`.

## Trustless Stable Tokens?



## Leveraged ETFs on the rise

We believe rebalancing leverage, lowering the risk of liquidation, is the future of leverage trading
